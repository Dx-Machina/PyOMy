   Problems you ran into and their solutions
   			1- I ran into a problem regarding pip. Starting with Python 3.11, on Debian distros, the Python Software Foundation 
					decided to disable pip since package managment was done by Debian package management, apt, to prevent the possibility
					of conflicts.
					I was able to resolve the issue by force using pip using the flag --break-system-packages with each pip command.
    What you learned from doing this project
    			Transformer models are not just the future, but the present as well. There's no need for massive and costly GPUs to run
	   			any of these models, and the proof is in the pi.
